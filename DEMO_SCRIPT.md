## 📋 PRESENTATION TIPS

### Technical Setup
- **Resolution:** 1920×1080 minimum
- **Browser:** Chrome/Firefox (ensure dev console closed)
- **Zoom:** 100% (Cmd+0 to reset)
- **Clear any:** Existing filters/bookmarks before starting
- **Test:** All modals open/close smoothly beforehand

### Pacing
- **Speak slowly** - Viewers need time to absorb visual info
- **Pause after clicks** - Let animations complete
- **Highlight with cursor** - Circle or point to elements as you mention them
- **Use transitions** - "Now let's look at...", "Next, I'll show you..."

### Camera/Audio
- **Voiceover:** Clear, enthusiastic but professional
- **Music:** Subtle background (optional) - something ambient, not distracting
- **Cursor:** Use large cursor or cursor highlighting tool

### Key Messages to Emphasize
1. **"310 works"** - Scale of corpus
2. **"Multidimensional exploration"** - Not just a list
3. **"Temporal DNA"** - Unique analytical framework
4. **"Unexpected connections"** - Discovery, not just search
5. **"Research + inspiration"** - Dual audience

### What to Avoid
- Don't get stuck on any one feature too long
- Don't show errors or broken links
- Don't apologize for missing features
- Don't go off-script into tangents
